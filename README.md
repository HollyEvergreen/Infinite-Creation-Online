    DAY 5
    </h2>
    <P>
    Today i started work on collescting the assets i need and the knowledge i need to implement the assets but we finally have a name for our studios "Yggdrasil studios" an a chief of business so we havent got any more devs but it will be easier to pitch the game to investors and i have my eyes on two potential candidates for our law teamso im probs gonna be on my own when it comes building the game for the foreseable future but im going to EGX soon so ill try and network some people there and spread news of the game there but all should go wellhopefully and im working on finding some artists to lift some of the load and ill have a server soon powered by the rasberry pi zero two so progress will start going super fast soon and when it is working at college ill have a base of operations to work from so watch this space and we at Yggdrasil studios are almost halfway to our goal of buying an oculus quest two to develop the vr implementation not just build the first floor of the game haha so wish us luck friends and I Holly will see you soon g'night.
